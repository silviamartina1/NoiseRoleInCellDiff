# NoiseRoleInCellDiffentiation 
This repository collects the code scripts written to perform stochastic simulations, vector fields stability analysis on the toggle-switch model studied in the paper : "The Construction Role of the Noise in Cell Fate Induction". The codes are two scripts in Python and other five scripts in Julia programming languagues. The script `Bifurcation_diagram_Fig2a.py` contains the code to generate Fig.2a. The script `VectorFields` is able to generate the Fig.2b and the other figures related to the stability analysis by setting the two parameters K<sub>X</sub> and K<sub>Y</sub>. The files in Julia are referred to the stochastic simulations. Specifically the file `Toggle_Switch_parameters_SYM.jl` and `Toggle_Switch_parameters_ASYM.jl` are those where the parameterd=s are set up, respectively for the symmetric case (K<sub>X</sub>=K<sub>Y</sub>) and for the asymmetric case (K_X )
