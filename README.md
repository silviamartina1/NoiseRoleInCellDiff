# NoiseRoleInCellDiffentiation 
This repository collects the code scripts written to perform stochastic simulations, vector fields stability analysis on the toggle-switch model studied in the paper : "The Construction Role of the Noise in Cell Fate Induction". The codes are two scripts in Python and other five scripts in Julia programming languagues. The
